Hi network,

As a student of the Bit-Academy, I am a fan of exploring and understanding how a piece of code works at my own pace.  
That's why I have taken the initiative to dedicate time to share my knowledge out of personal interest. I would like to show what I have created and what I continue to learn.

Here is an overview of what I have achieved:

Project: Connect Ollama AI models to PowerShell  
Level: Intermediate

What I applied and learned during this project:  
- How POST and GET requests work in PowerShell with Ollama models.  
- How to install and use Ollama in the terminal.

This is my way of using Ollama models in PowerShell.

Stay tuned, as I continue to expand and improve my work!

The code is linked in my GitHub.
